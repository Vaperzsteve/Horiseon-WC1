# Code Refactor Weekly Challenge - Horiseon

Assessment of documentation, semantic code elements and accessibility methods for html and css.

## Description

This 1st Weekly Challenge allows us to learn how to:
    1. document regularly what we change but also marking the sections start and end for every section.
    2. add semantic elements to appropriate sections.
    3. change any resulting links to work once the repo is set up correctly to view in Github Pages.
    4. Regularly use Git commands to push your repository live adding messages on commits.
